## About

This repo contains an Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Discord Bot.
The goal of this project was to create and provide completely personalizable AI Discord Bots.

It use the current working directory as its knowledge base (The files you add to that directory become the specific knowledge it knows). When the main Bot.py is run it will collect the files in its knowledge base and begin embedding them for use at context with the Prompt (Which is essentially a textual role play that personalizes the bot).

The bot can be given highly customizable information, and given a personality on how to act.
